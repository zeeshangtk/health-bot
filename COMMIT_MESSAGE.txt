refactor: Extract database logic into separate Health Service API

This commit implements a major architectural refactoring to separate
database operations from the Telegram bot into a standalone FastAPI
REST service.

## Changes

### New Health Service (health_svc/)
- Created FastAPI-based REST API service for health record management
- Moved database code from telegram_bot/storage/ to health_svc/storage/
- Implemented service layer (health_service.py, patient_service.py)
- Created Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- Added REST endpoints:
  - GET/POST /api/v1/patients
  - GET/POST /api/v1/records (with query filters)
- Configured CORS middleware for telegram_bot integration

### Telegram Bot Updates
- Created HTTP client (telegram_bot/clients/health_api_client.py) using httpx
- Updated all handlers to use HTTP client instead of direct database access:
  - handlers/add_record.py
  - handlers/add_patient.py
  - handlers/get_patients.py
  - handlers/view.py
  - handlers/export.py
- Updated config.py: removed database config, added HEALTH_SVC_API_URL
- Added httpx>=0.25.0 to requirements.txt
- All handlers now use async HTTP calls with proper error handling

### Configuration
- health_svc/config.py: Database and API server configuration
- Environment variables:
  - HEALTH_SVC_DB_DIR, HEALTH_SVC_DB_FILE, HEALTH_SVC_DB_PATH
  - HEALTH_SVC_HOST, HEALTH_SVC_PORT, HEALTH_SVC_RELOAD
  - HEALTH_SVC_API_URL (for telegram_bot)

## Benefits
- Separation of concerns: Database logic isolated from bot logic
- Scalability: API can be scaled independently
- Reusability: API can be used by other clients (web, mobile, etc.)
- Testability: Each layer can be tested independently
- Maintainability: Clear boundaries between components

## Migration Notes
- Database schema unchanged (backwards compatible)
- Existing database files continue to work
- Both services must run: health_svc API server and telegram_bot
- Set HEALTH_SVC_API_URL environment variable (default: http://localhost:8000)

## Testing
- All REST API endpoints tested and working
- Patient CRUD operations verified
- Health record CRUD operations verified
- Query filters (patient, record_type, limit) working
- Error handling (duplicate patients) working correctly
